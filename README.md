# Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy

In this project, I create a fictional tea shop website on my computer.

I was provided with design spec and image assets with design spec and image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer.
This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

Below is an image of the website that needs to be recreated.
